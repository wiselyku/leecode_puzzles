# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring


https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Basic Idea: Try the hint 3 of the puzzle. For each length of substring, check if the substring is a palindromic.


```python=

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        length = len(s)
        target_i = 0
        target_j = 0
        DP = []
        for i in range(length):
            DP.append([0]*length)           
            
        
        for i in range(length):
            DP[0][i] = 1
            
        for i in range(length-1):
            if s[i]==s[i+1]:
                DP[1][i] = 1
                target_i = 1
                target_j = i
            
          
        for i in range(2, length):
            for j in range(length-i):
                if DP[i-2][j+1]==1 and s[j] == s[j+i]:
                    DP[i][j] = 1
                    target_i = i 
                    target_j = j
                    
                    
        return s[target_j:target_j+target_i+1]
