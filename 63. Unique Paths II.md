# 63. Unique Paths II

https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/

Basic Idea: Use dynamic programming to record the number of paths to each location of the grid.  Then the answer would be the value we record in the right buttom grid.  


```python=
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        DP = [[0]*len(obstacleGrid[0])]*len(obstacleGrid)
        
        for i in range(len(obstacleGrid)):
            for j in range(len(obstacleGrid[0])):
                if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1:
                    DP[i][j] = 0
                    
                elif i>0 and j>0:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j] + DP[i][j-1]
                    
                elif i == 0 and j>0:

                    DP[i][j] = DP[i][j-1]
                    
                elif i>0 and j ==0:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j]
                    
                else:
                    DP[i][j] = 1
                    
        return DP[-1][-1]
                    

```
