# 1578. Minimum Deletion Cost to Avoid Repeating Letters

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletion-cost-to-avoid-repeating-letters/

Basic Idea: If there is a substring which is a repeating string and composed by a character, we will need to find which character cost most and then remove the others.


```python=
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, s: str, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        repeating = 0
        current_max = -1
        value = 0
        
        for i in range(1,len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1]:
                if repeating == 0:
                    repeating = 1
                    value = value + min(cost[i],cost[i-1])
                    current_max = max(cost[i],cost[i-1])
                    
                else: 
                    if current_max < cost[i]:
                        value = value + current_max
                        current_max = cost[i]
                    
                    else: 
                        value = value + cost[i]
                        
            else:
                repeating = 0
                current_max = -1
                    
        return value
            
```
