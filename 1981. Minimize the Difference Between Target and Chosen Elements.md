# 1981. Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-difference-between-target-and-chosen-elements/

Basic Idea: The idea is to store every possible combination but we remove those combination whose summation is greater than target. For those combination whose summation is greater than target, we only store the smallest one.  In our program, we use set data structure, this is because addition of a set is faster than append of an array.


```python=
class Solution:
    def minimizeTheDifference(self, mat: List[List[int]], target: int) -> int:
        diff = [0]
        
        for row in mat:
            new_diff = set()
            for element in row:
                for item in diff:
                    new_diff.add(element + item)
                    if element + item >= target:
                        break
                        
            
            diff = list(new_diff)
            diff.sort()
            
        result = None
        for item in diff:
            abs_diff = abs(target-item)
            if result is None:
                result = abs_diff
            result = min(result, abs_diff)
        
        return result  
```
