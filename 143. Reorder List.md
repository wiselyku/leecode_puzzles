# 143. Reorder List

https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/

Basic Idea: Use a stack to store pointers of the nodes and then change the order accordingly.  


```python=
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        stack = []
        node = head
        count = 0
        while node != None:
            stack.append(node)
            node = node.next
            count = count + 1
            
        node = head
        num = 0
        if count%2 == 0:
            num = int(count/2) -1
        else:
            num = int(count/2)
            
        for i in range(num):
            temp = node.next
            node.next = stack.pop(-1)
            stack[-1].next = None
            node.next.next = temp
            node = temp
```
