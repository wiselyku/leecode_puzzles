# 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/

Basic Idea: The difficulty of this puzzle is that we may need to spend too much time to find the maximum summation of the currnet item and item in the next row. So we use left_dp and right_dp to store the maximum value of each item of the row.  


```python=
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(points), len(points[0])
        dp = [[0]*n]*m
        for c in range(n):
            dp[0][c] = points[0][c]
        for r in range(1, m):
            left_dp = [float('-inf')] * n
            left_dp[0] = dp[r - 1][0]
            for c in range(1, n):
                left_dp[c] = max(left_dp[c - 1] - 1, dp[r - 1][c])
                
            right_dp = [float('-inf')] * n
            right_dp[-1] = dp[r - 1][n - 1]
            for c in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                right_dp[c] = max(right_dp[c + 1] - 1, dp[r - 1][c])
                    
            for c in range(n):
                dp[r][c] = points[r][c] + max(left_dp[c], right_dp[c])
        return max(dp[m - 1][c] for c in range(n))
