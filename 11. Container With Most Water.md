# 11. Container With Most Water

https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

Basic Idea: An observation is that the smaller vertical line should go forward.  This is because if the larger vertical line goes forward, the new container will never larger than previous container.  By this observation, we can figure the following code.  


```python=
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        current_max = 0
        i = 0
        j = len(height) - 1
        value = 0
        while j>i:
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                value = height[i] * (j-i)
                i = i + 1

                    
            elif height[i] > height[j]:
                value = height[j] * (j-i)
                j = j - 1
            
            else:
                value = height[j] * (j-i)
                i = i +1
                j = j - 1
                
            if current_max < value:
                current_max = value    
            
                        
        return current_max
```
