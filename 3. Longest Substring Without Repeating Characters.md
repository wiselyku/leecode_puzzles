# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Basic Idea: The idea is to count the longest substring without repeating character for each location of the string s.  When we meet a repeating character, we start remove the character from the beginning index until there is no repeating character in the current substring.


```python=
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        index = 0
        current_max = 0 
        result = 0
        d = dict()
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] in d:
                d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
                current_max = current_max + 1
                if d[s[i]] > 1:
                    while True:
                        current_max = current_max - 1
                        if s[index] == s[i]:
                            d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] - 1
                            index = index + 1
                            break
                        else:
                            d[s[index]] = d[s[index]] - 1
                            index = index + 1
                        
                                        
            else: 
                d[s[i]] = 1
                current_max = current_max + 1
               
            if current_max > result:
                result = current_max
                    
        
        return result
