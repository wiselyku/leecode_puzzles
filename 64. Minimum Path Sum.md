# 64. Minimum Path Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/

Basic Idea: Use dynamic programming to count the minimum path sum to each location of the grid.  Then, the answer of this puzzle will be the value of the right buttom grid.

```python=
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        DP = [[0]*len(grid[0])]*len(grid)
        
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if i>0 and j>0:
                    DP[i][j] = min(DP[i-1][j], DP[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j]
                    
                elif i == 0 and j>0:

                    DP[i][j] = DP[i][j-1] + grid[i][j]
                    
                elif i>0 and j ==0:
                    DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j] + grid[i][j]
                    
                else:
                    DP[i][j] = grid[i][j]
                    
        return DP[-1][-1]
