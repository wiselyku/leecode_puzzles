https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-move-all-balls-to-each-box/

Basic Idea: Solve the puzzle straightforwardly.  


```python=
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        answer = [0]*len(boxes)
        for i in range(len(boxes)):
            score = 0
            if boxes[i] == "1":
                for j in range(i+1, len(boxes)):
                    score += 1
                    answer[j] = answer[j] + score
                    
        for i in range(len(boxes)-1, -1, -1):
            score = 0 
            if boxes[i] == "1":
                for j in range(i-1,-1,-1):
                    score += 1
                    answer[j] = answer[j] + score
                    
        return answer
