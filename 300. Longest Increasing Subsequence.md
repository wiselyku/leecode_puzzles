# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/

Basic Idea: For each item in the nums list, we check which number is smaller than it and before it, and get the biggest number of that number in the DP.  After scaning all the items in nums, we will get the answer. 


```python=
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        sorted_nums = nums.copy()
        sorted_nums.sort()
        DP = [0]*len(nums)
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):

            ind = sorted_nums.index(nums[i])
            if ind > 0:
                maximum = max(DP[0:ind])
                DP[ind] = maximum + 1
            else:
                DP[ind] = 1
            
        result = max(DP[0:len(nums)])
        return result
```
