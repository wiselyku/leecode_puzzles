# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

Basic Idea: The number of different Binary Search Trees of n nodes is the same to the Catalan number of n.  So this question becomes to calculate the Catalan number efficiently.  


```python=

class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        def catalan(n):
            if (n == 0 or n == 1):
                return 1
 
            catalan =[0]*(n+1)
 
            catalan[0] = 1
            catalan[1] = 1

            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                for j in range(i):
                    catalan[i] += catalan[j]* catalan[i-j-1]
 
            return catalan[n]
        
        return catalan(n)

```
