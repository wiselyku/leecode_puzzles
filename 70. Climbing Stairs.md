# 70. Climbing Stairs

https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/

Basic Idea: Use Dynamic Programming to record the number of ways to climb the stairs.

```python=
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        DP = [0]*(n+1)
        DP[0] = 1
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i >= 1:
                DP[i] = DP[i-1] + DP[i]
                
            if i>= 2:
                DP[i] = DP[i-2] + DP[i]
                
        return DP[n]
        
```
