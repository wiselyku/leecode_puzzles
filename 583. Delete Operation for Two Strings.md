# 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-operation-for-two-strings/

Basic Idea: This puzzle is a modification of Longest common subsequence puzzle.  The basic idea is the same. Just the output is not the same.


```python=
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        DP = [] 
        for i in range(len(word1)+1):
            DP.append([0]*(len(word2)+1))
            
        
        for i in range(1,len(word1)+1):
            for j in range(1,len(word2)+1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    tmp = DP[i-1][j-1] + 1
                    DP[i][j] = max(tmp,DP[i-1][j],DP[i][j-1])
                    
                else:
                    DP[i][j] =  max(DP[i-1][j],DP[i][j-1])
                    
                    
        return len(word1)+len(word2)- 2*DP[len(word1)][len(word2)]
