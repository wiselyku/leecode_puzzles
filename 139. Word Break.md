# 139. Word Break

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/

Basic Idea: Use dp[i] to check if s string can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.  dp[i] means s[:i+1] can be segmented into words in the wordDicts 
        


```python=

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:

        dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1) 
        # dp[i] means s[:i+1] can be segmented into words in the wordDicts 
        
        dp[0] = True
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                if dp[i] and s[i: j+1] in wordDict:
                    dp[j+1] = True
                    
        return dp[-1]

```
