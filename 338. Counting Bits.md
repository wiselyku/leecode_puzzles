# 338. Counting Bits

https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/

Basic Idea: We use dynamic programming strategy to design the algorithm.  The idea is to use the previous result.  For example, 9 -> 1001 = 8 + 1 = 1000 + 0001.
So we separate the first bit and the others.  We know that the result of others' bits has been calculated before.  Therefore, we just need to sum them up.


```python=
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:

        DP = [0]*(n+1)
        divisor = 2
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i % divisor == 0:
                DP[i] = 1
                divisor = divisor*2
            else:
                DP[i] = 1 + DP[i-int(divisor/2)]
                
        return DP
```
