# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/

Basic Idea:  Actually, the problem is the same as "Given a collection of intervals, find the maximum number of intervals that are non-overlapping." (the classic Greedy problem: Interval Scheduling).


```python=
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals= sorted(intervals,key=lambda x: x[1])
        end = intervals[0][1]
        count = 1
        print(intervals)
        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0]>=end:
                end = intervals[i][1]
                count = count + 1
            
        return len(intervals) - count
            

```
