# 343. Integer Break

https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/

Basic Idea: Ths puzzle is more like a math question.  The idea is to check the product sum of each k paritions and then keep the current maximum.  Then, print the result of the current maximum. 


```python=
class Solution:
    def integerBreak(self, n: int) -> int:
        current_max = 0 
        for k in range(2,n+1):
            tmp = n%k
            product = int(n/k)
            product_sum = 1
            for i in range(tmp):
                product_sum = product_sum * (product+1)
                
            for i in range(k-tmp):
                product_sum = product_sum * product
                
            if product_sum > current_max:
                current_max = product_sum
                
                
        return current_max
                
```
